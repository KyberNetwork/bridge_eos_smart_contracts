todo next:
*ned to split 128*64 array to 2 because of wasm limitations!
*continue profiling, use bytes array instead of string (write script)

status:
*last working code when running natively: d6ee697f6b59b6c6f53f275a678e7399b6e5218a
*keccak256/512 is returning an array and not memcpying to input ret array, otherwise got crashes.
*dag_sizes array got errors on its size, decreased it from 2048 to 200 for now.
*test_info struct had to be allocated on the heap, otherwise got error originating from lack of stack space.
*HexToArr2 is used in several places instead of HexToArr, for simplicity.
*proofs_4700000 array contains only 2 proofs and not 64 for now.
*"#ifndef EOSIO" should be organized more neatly.

failure:
*currently failing on "assert(0==memcmp( res, expected_root, 16));",need to further investigate.
*reaching limit of running time per single tx, need to profile!
