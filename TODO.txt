status:
*functionality of ethash verification and merkle proofs works as eosio contract.
*aligned to following commit in ethashproof tool: a137ac2db276aa36f37e37036b0bbe5e0e12b703
*last supported code when running natively on x86: d6ee697f6b59b6c6f53f275a678e7399b6e5218a

caveats:
*using only 3 proofs since getting transaction too long error.
*further limited to only 30 proofs because of "/usr/local/bin/cleos: Argument list too long" error
*keccak256/512 is returning an array and not memcpying to input ret array, otherwise got crashes.
*dag_sizes array got errors on its size, decreased it from 2048 to 200 for now.
*test_info struct had to be allocated on the heap, otherwise got error originating from lack of stack space.
